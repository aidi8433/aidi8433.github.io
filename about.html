		My full name is Aidai Nurieva. 
		I was born in Kyrgyzstan, in 1994.   
		I tend to be really impatient and curious, but I do not consider it a disadvantage. 
		I think I've told everything about myself. 
		I do not think my life is boring because every day is full with something new and interesting for me. 
		Finding my purpose and gaining inner peace is my main goal now.
